<h1>2024 Movies</h1>
 <h2>Movies I watched this year</h2>
<hr />
   <h3>The proposal</h3>
    <p>It's a really funny film with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, I got halfaway through it and then realised that I'd already seen it.</p> 
   <h3>The Other Woman</h3>
    <p>Another great film, I fell completely in love with Cameron Diaz.</p>
   <h3>Bride Wars</h3>
    <p>I watched this film when I was younger and had great memories of it, it was alright. I love Anne Hathaway.</p>
   <h3>Absolutely Fabulous: The Movies</h3>
    <p>This was by far one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, it almost ruined the show for me.</p> 
   <h3>Bad teacher</h3>
    <p>I honestly expected more but it did I have funny moments and i was thrilled to see that Jason Segel was one of the main characters.</p> 
   <h3>In her Shoes</h3>
    <p>This film was honestly painful to watch, there was nothing good about it apart from the main actress.</p>
